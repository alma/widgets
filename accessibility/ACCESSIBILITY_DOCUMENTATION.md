- **13.3**: Documents are accessible
- **13.8**: Content changes are announced
- Implementation: `aria-live` regions for dynamic content updates

## Implemented Accessibility Features

### 1. Semantic HTML Structure
```html
<!-- Example: Modal structure -->
<div role="dialog" aria-modal="true" aria-labelledby="modal-title">
  <h1 id="modal-title">Payment Options</h1>
  <!-- Content -->
</div>
```

### 2. ARIA Attributes
- **aria-labelledby**: Links headings to content sections
- **aria-describedby**: Provides additional context
- **aria-live**: Announces dynamic content changes
- **aria-pressed**: Indicates button states
- **aria-current**: Identifies current selection
- **role**: Defines element purpose (dialog, region, radiogroup, etc.)

### 3. Keyboard Navigation
- Full keyboard accessibility with logical tab order
- Custom focus management for modals and dynamic content
- Skip links for efficient navigation
- Proper `tabIndex` management

### 4. Screen Reader Support
- Custom `useAnnounceText` hook for dynamic announcements
- Live regions for status updates
- Screen reader only content with `sr-only` class
- Descriptive alternative text for images

### 5. Focus Management
- Visible focus indicators
- Focus trap in modals
- Programmatic focus setting for skip links
- Logical tab order throughout the interface

## Component-Specific Accessibility

### EligibilityModal
- **Role**: `dialog` with `aria-modal="true"`
- **Labeling**: `aria-labelledby` references modal title
- **Focus**: Automatic focus management on open/close
- **Structure**: Proper heading hierarchy with hidden headings for screen readers

### PaymentPlans
- **Radio Group**: `role="radiogroup"` for payment options
- **State Management**: `aria-pressed` and `aria-current` for selected options
- **Announcements**: Dynamic selection announcements via `useAnnounceText`
- **Keyboard**: Full keyboard navigation support

### SkipLinks
- **Navigation**: `role="navigation"` with descriptive `aria-label`
- **Focus Management**: Programmatic focus setting on target elements
- **Accessibility**: First elements in tab order for immediate access

### Schedule Component
- **Structure**: `role="region"` with hidden heading
- **Context**: `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby` for clarity
- **Content**: Semantic list structure for installments

### Loading States
- **Status**: `role="status"` with `aria-live="polite"`
- **Feedback**: Clear loading indicators for all users
- **Announcements**: Screen reader notifications for state changes

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Automated Testing
- Jest accessibility tests using `@testing-library/jest-dom`
- ARIA attribute validation
- Keyboard navigation testing
- Focus management verification

### 2. Manual Testing
- Screen reader testing (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Keyboard-only navigation
- High contrast mode compatibility
- Zoom testing up to 200%

### 3. Test Coverage
- All interactive elements have accessibility tests
- ARIA attributes are validated in component tests
- Focus management is tested for modal interactions
- Announcement functionality is thoroughly tested

## Development Guidelines

### 1. ARIA Best Practices
- Use semantic HTML first, ARIA as enhancement
- Provide meaningful labels and descriptions
- Implement proper state management
- Use live regions for dynamic content

### 2. Focus Management
- Ensure visible focus indicators
- Implement logical tab order
- Manage focus for dynamic content
- Provide skip links for complex interfaces

### 3. Content Structure
- Use proper heading hierarchy
- Implement semantic markup
- Provide alternative text for images
- Structure content logically

### 4. Testing Requirements
- Write accessibility tests for all components
- Test with keyboard navigation
- Validate ARIA implementations
- Test with screen readers when possible

## Future Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling
- Implement `aria-invalid` for form validation
- Add `aria-describedby` for error messages
- Improve error announcement timing

### 2. Advanced Navigation
- Consider implementing `aria-roledescription` for custom controls
- Add landmark navigation for complex layouts
- Implement breadcrumb navigation if applicable

### 3. Personalization
- Support for reduced motion preferences
- High contrast theme options
- Font size customization support

### 4. Testing Enhancements
- Automated accessibility testing in CI/CD
- Regular accessibility audits
- User testing with assistive technology users

## Conclusion

The Alma Payment Widgets demonstrate a strong commitment to accessibility, implementing comprehensive RGAA compliance measures that ensure an inclusive experience for all users. The combination of semantic HTML, proper ARIA usage, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support creates a robust accessible foundation.

The implementation includes custom accessibility hooks, comprehensive testing coverage, and clear development guidelines to maintain accessibility standards as the project evolves.
